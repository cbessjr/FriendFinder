  ### Future Updates
  
  - Fix the functionality in the application. I worked with the application for several hours comparing against class activity work, with no success. Ultimately I deleted the functionality that was not working and searched for code on the web to help supplement my work. I was still not able to get the application to work. I have submitted the work I was able to complete. I will go back to complete the application to add to my portfolio.
